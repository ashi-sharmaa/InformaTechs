    <p class ="about-two"> As the technology industry grows rapidly in the modern world, many people lack access to educational resources that promote awareness of computer science and related fields. Our mission is to change that statement by providing individuals with general information about various tech fields, as well as resources to help them learn more about organizations with which they can become involved to satisfy their curiosity. We want this website to be a place where people can be inspired to expand their knowledge and understanding of the tech world as they explore potential career paths. </p>
