    <h3> What is Data Science?</h3> 
<p> Data science is a multidisciplinary field that involves extracting insights and knowledge from structures and unstructured data. It combines elements of mathematics, statistics, programming, and domain expertise to analyze large and complex datasets and make data-driven decisions.

Career positions within data science involve utilizing database management systems, commonly relational databases. Well-known examples of these include Oracle, MySQL, MicrosoftSQLServer, PostgreSQL, and more. Immense groups of data values are organized into these systems, and are analyzed frequently for daily use in many industries.

For example, a business may invest in high-end databases in order to manage customer information, online orders, or employment statuses. In other terms, a stadium may use a database for ticket holdings or product imports. Even schools and colleges implement databases for incoming students, transcript information, etcetera.
