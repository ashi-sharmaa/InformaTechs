    <h3>What is Robotics?</h3>

    <p>Robotics is the design and construction of robots that combines computer science, computer engineering, and electronics. There are five major fields of robotics: operator interface, mobility or locomotion, manipulators and effectors, programming, and sensing and perception, all of which contribute to the maintenance and design of all robots. Robots have applications in various fields, including medicine, machinery, and even underwater exploration. Prosthetics, a sub-branch of robotics, for example, are used in the medical field as substitutes for body parts, allowing individuals to perform daily tasks more easily. Robotics engineers, mechanical engineers, and software engineers are examples of jobs that incorporate different aspects of robotics. </p>
