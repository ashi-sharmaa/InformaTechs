   <h3> What is Artifical Intelligence and Machine Learning?</h3>
   <p> 
     Artificial intelligence, commonly known as AI, refers to the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that usually require human intelligence. It involves creating algorithms and models that allow machines to learn from data, recognize patterns, make decisions, and solve problems. AI can be applied in various fields such as healthcare, finance, transportation, and entertainment. It encompasses technologies like machine learning, which enables computers to automatically improve their performance through experience, and deep learning, which involves training neural networks to process complex data. AI has the potential to revolutionize industries, enhance efficiency, and contribute to scientific advancements. However, ethical considerations and responsible development are crucial to ensure AI benefits society in a fair and safe manner.
<br></br> Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence where computers are trained to learn and make predictions without being explicitly programmed. By analyzing large amounts of data, computers can identify patterns and make informed decisions. This technology is used in various applications, such as voice assistants, recommendation systems, and self-driving cars. Machine learning continually improves as it learns from new data, making it a powerful tool with the potential to transform how we solve problems and make decisions.
