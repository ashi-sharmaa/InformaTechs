  <h3>What is Software Engineering?</h3>

  <p>Software engineering consists of developing, testing, designing, and maintaining software applications. Software engineers use principles from the engineering realm to build software used in video games, business apps, operating systems, etc. There are numerous careers and titles available for those who choose to pursue software engineering, including systems developers, programmers, systems analysts, and, of course, software engineers. These roles vary in terms of day-to-day tasks, which can consist of writing code, consulting with clients, ensuring cross-platform compatability, and collaborating with development teams.</p>

    <h3>Potential Career Fields: </h3>
    <p>
   <b>Computer Network Architects:</b> 
      Computer Network Architects work to design and build data communication networks and Intranets. These networks range in size from small connections to cloud infrastructures. They create plans and layouts, present plans to management, upgrade hardware and software, and research emerging technologies to better support their client organizations. <br><br>

    <b>Computer and Information Research Scientists:</b>
      Computer and Information Research Scientists design uses for new and existing technologies. They study and solve problems in computing for business, science, medicine, and other fields. They develop theories and models to address problems in computing, collaborate with scientists and engineers, develop new computing languages, conduct experiments to test software system operations, analyze their results, and write papers for publication. <br><br>

    <b>Computer Programmers:</b>
      Computer programmers write and test code and scripts to allow computer software and applications to function. Instead of designing the code themselves, they turn the designs created by software developers and engineers into code. They write programs in many different computer languages, expand and update programs, test for errors and debug code, and find the most efficient way of writing their code.<br><br>

    <b>Computer Support Specialists:</b>
       Computer support specialists assist users and organizations by maintaining computer networks or providing technical help to users. They test and evaluate existing network systems, perform regular maintainance or ensure that networks are in operation, and troubleshoot local, wide area, and internet networks.<br><br>

    <b>Computer Systems Analysts:</b>
      Computer systems analysts study an organization's current computer systems and procedures, designing improvements to them. They can consult with managers to determine the role of IT systems in an organization, research different technologies to improve efficiency, test systems, and calculate computing requirements for their company. <br><br>

      <b>PSoftware Developers, Quality Assurance Analysts, and Testers:</b>
      Software developers, quality assurance analysts, and testers are all involved in the process of creating a software program. While developers analyze users' needs, develop software to meet those needs, and ensure that the program continues to function, analysts and testers test out the software, identify risks, and document defects. <br><br>
