    <h3> A Quick Dive Into AI Ethics </h3>
  <p> The world is increasingly utilizing AI, or artificial intelligence, in order to simplify everyday life in various ways. Some examples that most of us are familiar with include Alexa, Siri, ChatGPT, Grammarly, and OpenAI. In more professional environments, many hospitals and businesses use AI algorithms to carry out data tasks, diagnoses, and more. While these systems provide beneficial purposes as home assistants, writing enhancements, business management, etc, there is a lot of room for risky, harmful effects on society when dealing with AI. Now this is where AI ethics come in. We don't want the world to be taken over by evil robots, do we? <br> <br> With an ethical set of guidelines regarding AI, we can prevent human bias from damaging the outcomes of emerging technology. For example, many datasets that are used for healthcare applications lack diversity in terms of patients of color, therefore skewing results and preventing quality aid and resources to be distributed on an equal basis. On a bigger scale, new facial recognition tools on applications used by companies like Apple tend to result in a large fraction of error, placing a dangerous factor into the security and safety of numerous individuals. <br> <br> In order to protect individual liberties and the well-being of humanity, the environment, and society, the following core values are commonly agreed on as basic ethical beliefs to follow: <br> Human rights and dignity <br> A peaceful, just, and intertwined society <br> Diversity, accessibility, sustainability, and inclusion <br> A healthy environment <br> Proportionality without harm <br> Data privacy <br> Worldwide governance and transparency <br> Accountability and Literacy <br> <br> The field of AI is, as a result, tremendously growing, as the effort to positively make an impact using this powerful technology is needed. There is always a reason to discuss about the potential risks of AI and how to mitigate them because many people are concerned about what it might do to the human species. To be able to direct AI in a way that continues to benefit humankind, we must first educate ourselves about what AI is and how it is evolving. Second, we must remove prejudices ingrained in AI systems and train them to discrimination as little as possible. And finally, in order to prevent any accidents from affecting the human population, laws governing the use of AI in society must be established. So, for instance, as AI is increasingly used in vehicles and driving, we must ensure that, if and when AI entirely replaces driving, ethics are ingrained in AI. If you are interested in looking to a future working with AI, we need you! A multitude of human perspectives, backgrounds, and beliefs are essential towards eliminating bias/discrimination and progressing towards a safer space for AI. </p>
